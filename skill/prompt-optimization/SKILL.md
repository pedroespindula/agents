## What I do

- Clarify objectives and success criteria for your prompts
- Constrain outputs with explicit formats and examples
- Add context and assumptions to reduce ambiguity
- Iterate based on observed outputs to refine results

## When to use me

Use this skill when you need to improve the quality and consistency of prompts for LLMs or other AI systems. This is especially helpful when:

- Your prompts produce inconsistent or unclear results
- You need reproducible outputs across multiple runs
- You're designing prompts for production use
- You want to establish best practices for prompt engineering

## How I work

I follow a four-step optimization process:

1. **Clarify objectives** - Define what success looks like
2. **Constrain outputs** - Specify formats, examples, and boundaries
3. **Add context** - Make assumptions and requirements explicit
4. **Iterate** - Refine based on actual results

Ask clarifying questions if the prompt's purpose or target audience is unclear.
